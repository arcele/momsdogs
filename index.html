 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Lucas is the mild mannered, loving, and rather chubby littermate of Marley.  Lucas is half labrador, half standard poodle, and all love.  He'll stay by your side at any moment, especially if he thinks that there's a treat in it for him.  He loves walks through the woods and laying on the porch in the sunshine, and keeping an eye out for any accidentally dropped food.  He doesn't spend much time nosing through the trash, but we all have an inkling that he encourages his brother to participate in these activities and he's not such a great lookout since his brother is always getting caught.</p>

 	 <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/marley.png" /></div>Marley</div>
 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Marley is kind of a jerk, but we all love him any way.  He is brothers from the same litter with Lucas, making them the only two living Wieddoggs that are blood related.  He's a labradoodle with a courageous, even fearless disposition which is part of what makes him such a jerk.  He doesn't seem to have any idea what common courtesy is.  His favorite snack is whatever is in the trash but he's very faithful and loyal to his family members.</p>
