 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Sadie may be the smallest member of the Wieddoggs, but she sure doesn't act that way.  The first yorkie member of the Wieddogs, joining the clan on April 6, 2013, her admission into the Wieddogg clan turned a once-proud large dog family into a home welcoming and loving dogs of all sizes.  While some of her new, larger companions may have thought they could push her around upon her arrival, they were quickly corrected by a confident, spunky little girl who knows how to hold her own</p> 
		
		<p>Sadie is a staunch protector of her home, her brother Sushi, and most of all, her family.  She'd never back down from any challenge when it comes to keeping her family and home safe.  She also loves to show her love and affection for all of her human family members.  She has the occasional wrestling match with her Yorkie siblings and usually comes out on top, but after the battles all is forgiven and she's back to being best friends with them all.</p>

 	 <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/lucas.png" /></div>Lucas</div>
 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Lucas is the mild mannered, loving, and rather chubby littermate of Marley.  Lucas is half labrador, half standard poodle, and all love.  He'll stay by your side at any moment, especially if he thinks that there's a treat in it for him.  He loves walks through the woods and laying on the porch in the sunshine, and keeping an eye out for any accidentally dropped food.  He doesn't spend much time nosing through the trash, but we all have an inkling that he encourages his brother to participate in these activities and he's not such a great lookout since his brother is always getting caught.</p>

 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Marley is kind of a jerk, but we all love him any way.  He is brothers from the same litter with Lucas, making them the only two living Wieddoggs that are blood related.  He's a labradoodle with a courageous, even fearless disposition which is part of what makes him such a jerk.  He doesn't seem to have any idea what common courtesy is.  His favorite snack is whatever is in the trash but he's very faithful and loyal to his family members.</p>
