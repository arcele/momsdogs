 	<div class="dog collapsed sadie">
 	 <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/sadie.png" /></div>Sadie Mae</div>
 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Sadie may be the smallest member of the Wieddoggs, but she sure doesn't act that way.  The first yorkie member of the Wieddogs, joining the clan on April 6, 2013, her admission into the Wieddogg clan turned a once-proud large dog family into a home welcoming and loving dogs of all sizes.  While some of her new, larger companions may have thought they could push her around upon her arrival, they were quickly corrected by a confident, spunky little girl who knows how to hold her own.</p> 
		
		<p>Sadie is a staunch protector of her home, her sister Sushi, and most of all, her family.  She'd never back down from any challenge when it comes to keeping her family and home safe.  She also loves to show her love and affection for all of her human family members.  She has the occasional wrestling match with her Yorkie siblings and usually comes out on top, but after the battles all is forgiven and she's back to being best friends with them all.</p>

 	<div class="dog collapsed sushi">
 	 <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/sushi.png" /></div>Sushi</div>
 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Sushi joined the Wieddog clan the Christmas after Sadie, officially comming home on December 21 of 2013.  As soon as Sushi came into home she became best friends with Sadie Mae and her Wiedmann bretheren.  She may be a little chunky for a yorkie, but that just leaves more of her to love, and she's always willing to share all of her love with everyone.</p>
    
    <p>Sushi's hobbies include wrestling with her siblings, licking faces, and tearing bows out of her hair.  But, what Sushi really loves is to curl up near her sister for a little nap time.  We know what you're thinking, and no, Sushi does not in fact eat Sushi.</p>

 	 <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/sonic.png" /></div>Sonic</div>
 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Sonic Boom is the newest member of the Wieddoggs, he came home on February 8, 2015 and immediately fit in with his yorkie sisters.  He is a Biewer Terrier which is very similar to a yorkie with a tri colored marking.   He's young and full of energy and a great friend to all dogs and people alike.</p>

 	 	<p>As a young growing boy, Sonic loves to spend lazy afternoons napping to recover from his hours of play around the house.  He's a bit of a rabblerouser, but also a gentle dog who loves to nestle up on a warm pillow for a nap.</p>

 	<div class="dog collapsed lucas">
 	 <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/lucas.png" /></div>Lucas</div>
 	 <div class="description">
 	 	<p>Lucas is the mild mannered, loving, and rather chubby littermate of Marley.  Lucas is half labrador, half standard poodle, and all love.  He'll stay by your side at any moment, especially if he thinks that there's a treat in it for him.  He loves walks through the woods and laying on the porch in the sunshine, and keeping an eye out for any accidentally dropped food.  He doesn't spend much time nosing through the trash, but we all have an inkling that he encourages his brother to participate in these activities.  He's also proven himself to be a pretty bad lookout for his brother since Marley is always getting caught with his face in the trash.</p>
    
    <p>Lucas had a tough youth, living away from his fellow Wieddoggs as a puppy and labeled as a trouble maker.  When he was brought into the Wieddog clan though everything changed and he's a very well behaved and loving labradoodle these days.  Be careful if you come upon this big boy, his favorite move is to nuzzle his nose between your legs to give himself a gap big enough for him to sneak through to get a full body pet.  It can be a bit intimidating at first, but you'll love giving this loveable mutt all of the petting and attention he asks for</p>

 	<div class="dog collapsed marley">
 	 <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/marley.png" /></div>Marley</div>
 	 <div class="description">
    <p>Oh Marley, why do you act the way that you do.  Maybe it was a bad idea to name the first labradoodle after the trouble making dog from the popular book, "Marley And Me," he definitely took on a similar personality.  He is littermates with Lucas, making them the only two living Wieddoggs that are blood related, but most of the similarities end there.  The bottom line is that Marley is kind of a jerk, but we all love him any way.  He's a labradoodle with a courageous, even fearless disposition which is part of what makes him such a jerk.  He doesn't seem to have any idea what common courtesy is.  His favorite snack is whatever is in the trash, but he's very faithful and loyal to his family and pack members.</p>
 	 	
 	 	<p>Marley was brought into the Wieddog clan as a puppy, and spent some time living off in Maryland where he was part of a one dog clan, but still a full-fledged member of the Wieddoggs.  His time in Maryland was his most well behaved.  He responded well to structure and one on one attention, but when he came back to his Delaware home with several dog buddies, he quickly became quite the doggy terrorist.  No meal is safe on the table around Marley, and you better be sure that the trash is taken out if you're going to leave him alone.  Even with all of the trouble that Marley causes, he's still beloved by all of his doggy and human friends.  Marley always keeps our lives interesting.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed shamrock alumni">
  <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/shamrock.png" /></div>Shamrock</div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>If there is a sweeter, kinder dog than Shamrock somewhere in the world, we have certainly never met them.  Shamrock, the yellow lab, was one of the most beloved of all of the Wieddogs.  She was also a loving mother to many litters of puppies that lead her to be related to a lot of the old timers listed below.  She was always a very caring and attentive mother to all of her puppies, and she treated all of her human and dog family members just as well.  Forever loyal, especially to her favorite Wiedmann, the family matriarch.  If she was wondering around the house, you could be certain that Shamrock was right by her side.</p>

    <p>Shamrock's great loving attitude was rewarded with many years on this Earth.  She outlasted many others who came into the home, living more than 15 years.  Even until her last days she always remained the most loving dog that any of us have ever met.  Whether you called her Shamrock, Shammy, Sheshe, or Shamalama, she would always great you with a smile and a tail wagging so hard that she shook her entire butt.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed grady alumni">
  <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/grady.png" /></div>Grady White</div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Grady White, the yellow lab, ruled the Wieddogg roost for many years across several different homes.  You might not be able to tell from this cute puppy picture of him, but  he was one tough dog.  Living in the house with as many as 8 dogs at once, no dog would dare challenge Grady and he often sat perched atop the steps overlooking his entire kingdom.  Although he ruled the dogs with an iron fist and would protect our home over anything else, he always treated all of his human friends with love and respect.</p>
    <p>Of all of the labradors, Grady was the most prolific of all when it came to playing fetch.  He was an expert of the craft of chasing tennis balls and sticks and would play for hours without compromise.  Trips to the beach were always high on his priority list and he would typically make those trips with several of his fellow Wieddoggs who he would always keep in check.  He also loved to jump on the trampoline with the kids for a hopping good time.</p>

<div class="dog collapsed junior alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/junior.png" /></div>Junior</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>For most of the humans in the Wiedmann clan, Junior was the first dog we ever got to know as our own.  Sure, he was a mutt of unknown origin to most of us, but he was the best friend of the Wiedmann patriarch for years before we got to meet him.  Energetic, friendly, loyal, out going, and fun loving were all traits that Junior was always proud to share with all of his companions.  Like Grady, Junior was a lover of the beach and a champion of fetch, in fact Grady learned a lot from Junior.  The two were best friends for years and Junior was always a great doggy mentor to Grady.</p>
    <p>Junior set the tone for all of the other Wieddoggs, teaching them as puppies how to act, and how to play.  Junior's time overlapped mostly with Grady and Waldo but he was lucky enough to have the most time as a solo Wieddogg but he also loved having other dog buddies to play with.  Junior's legacy will always live on, as the lessons that he taught to puppies when they entered the clan are still being taught to new dogs when they enter the house by dogs that never even had the pleasure of meeting him.  Junior was proof that you can have a great dog who is a mutt.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed waldo alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/waldo.png" /></div>Waldo</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Waldo entered our lives on a Christmas Morning in the early 90s as a gift to all of the kids from Santa.  If you'd ever met Waldo, you might think that he wasn't the brightest bulb in the bunch, and you'd be right.  Most of the blame for his percieved lack of intellegence was his love for anything sweet.  As a puppy, he wandered into the garage and found a nice bowl of what looked like some Hi-C Ecto Cooler in a pan on the floor which he helped himself to.  Sadly, for him, it was actually antifreeze, luckily he was caught in the act.  He got taken outside for a little peroxide in the belly to help puke it out.  Luckily he was caught early enough to save his life, and even if it did make him a little fuzzy in the head for the rest of the days, he never lost his sweet cuddly disposition.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed mako alumni">
  <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/mako.png" /></div>Mako</div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Mako Marine was a rare silver lab who was brought in from Minnesota to join the Wieddoggs as a puppy.  His looks caused a lot of confusion from dog loving onlookers.  No, he wasn't a Weimaraner with a long tail, but a rare type of a chocolate lab with a recessive gene causing him to have a brilliant silver coat that shined.  Easy to get along with and full of energy at all times, Mako was a wonderful lab who got along great with his fellow Wieddogs, asside from a few scuffles.  He loved running around the yard and chasing his buddies.</p>
  </div>

 <div class="dog collapsed cabo alumni">
  <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/cabo.png" /></div>Cabo</div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Cabo was one tough cookie.  She was a black lab, from Donzi's first litter, who took no nonsense from anyone.  Cabo never had any puppies of her own, probably because all of the males were always to afraid to approach her in that context.  She was a staunch defender of her fellow female dogs and female human friends as well.  Loyal to her mother's side for her whole life, she will always be remembered as a stocky little girl who loved her fellow ladies.</p>

  <div class="dog collapsed rybo alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/rybo.png" /></div>Rybo Runner</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Rybo Runner had a little bit of Shamrock and Grady White in her, literally and figuratively.  She had a personality a lot like Grady, if she had been born a male, she may have taken over as the alpha dog of the clan, but as a female she still managed to handle herself with plenty of confidence.  Rybo would never back down from another one of her Wieddog coherts, but she was incredibly faithful to both the patriarch and matriarch of the house.  While her attitude would make her a handful from time to time, she was a very well loved dog, as yellow labs tend to be amongst the Wieddogs.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed donzi alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/paw.png" /></div>Donzi</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Donzi was the first black lab member of the Wieddoggs.  She was a loving mother of many litters of pups and a loyal companion for many years.  Mother of Cabo, she may have given a bit of her attitude to her, but Donzi has a much more forgiving dog, and didn't mind a little male companionship from dogs or from her human friends.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed parker alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/paw.png" /></div>Parker</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Parker, the chocolate lab was a sweet girl, the daughter of Silver Lab Mako, she had a litter of pups of her own.  The first chocolate lab since the amazing Waldo first appeared in our lives, Parker was much more intellegent than Waldo, but equally as sweet.  She was mother to Pac, and although her life ended too soon, she'll always be remembered for her loving, playful attitude.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed whaler alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/paw.png" /></div>Boston Whaler</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Whaler was another of the great black labs of the Wieddoggs.  Littermate of Topaz, he was always looking out for his brother, and the two were inseperable for most of their lives.  A boisterous, energetic dog, Whaler lived during the time when the Wieddogg clan was at it's largest, and Whaler wouldn't have had it any other way.  With plenty of companions to play with at any time, he was one happy camper.  Late night trips to the fridge for that midnight snack were sure to be meant by a hopeful Whaler, ready for a little treat and late night one on one attention.</p>

 <div class="dog collapsed topaz alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/paw.png" /></div>Topaz</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Topaz was not the brightest bulb in the bunch, so he probably would have gotten along great with Waldo if their lives had overlapped.  He was usually known as "Bear Dog" around the house for his famous bear collar and for his kind demeanor.  Topaz may have not had all of the smarts in the world, but he was incredibly sweet, usually greeting all of his human friends with a big smile. </p>

<div class="dog collapsed albie alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/paw.png" /></div>Albemarle</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Albemarle, usually known as Albie certainly takes the cake for the largest of all of the Wieddoggs.  It's not that he was taller, or longer, or lankier than any of the other Wieddogs, oh no.  He was one fat dog.  He had the pleasure of living with a large number of dogs during his life and he took advantage by eating more than his fair share of food every day.  Albie could always be found sprawled out in the kitchen, gut hanging out, happy as can be.  While he would have stuck around with us for longer if he had watched his weight, he had a remarkably long life as it was, he was one happy boy and we don't think he would have wanted it any other way.</p>
   </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dog collapsed pac alumni">
   <div class="dogHeading"><div class="badge"><img src="img/pac.png"></div>Pac</div>
   <div class="description">
    <p>Pac was related to pretty much every member of the Wieddoggs that he lived with.  Parker was his mother, making Mako his grand father, and pretty much everyone else is cousin, aunt, or uncle.  Pac spent his younger days partying hard in Morgantown, West Virginia rooting on the Mountaineers and indulging in Natty Lights before a brief stay back at the old homestead.  He spent a lot of time away from the main Wieddogg house, but he always loved visiting his relatives there.  He'd endure 6 and 7 hour car trips through the traffic and the snow, and as soon as the the clan was in smelling distance, he'd hop up, stick his head out the window and start sniffing, he knew it was party time.</p>
    <p>He really hated being alone, which is the main reason he loved coming back to house filled with dogs and loving humans.  Fetch was his game of choice and he is the unofficial world record holder in speed eating a rawhide.  He was friendly to all animals, including skunks who he several run ins with.</p>

   <div class="description">
    <p>One fine day, the future Wiedmann matriarch found a dog she had to have.  The tricky thing was that she was still living at home with her parents.  The only thing that she could think to do was to cover Trouble up and sneak him into the house.  The rest, as they say, is history, and an entire family full of dog lovers was created, leading the great legacy that you see before you.</p>
